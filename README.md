# 🤖 AI Agents: A Step-by-Step Guide  

Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are everywhere. Innovative implementations and groundbreaking ideas are transforming the way we interact with technology. However, keeping up with this evolution can be challenging, and the concept often seems more complex than it actually is.  

This guide simplifies everything in a structured and accessible way. By the end, you will not only understand what AI agents are but also create one yourself.

## 🚀 What Are AI Agents?  

With the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), new applications have emerged, one of which is the concept of AI Agents. Unlike traditional LLMs, which are static and limited to training data, AI agents can interact with their environment and access external tools to perform tasks in real-time.  

An AI agent consists of two main components:  

- **AI Model (LLMs):** Responsible for reasoning, planning, and decision-making.  
- **Tools:** Specialized functions that expand the agent’s capabilities, allowing interaction with APIs, web searches, image generation, and more.  

With this structure, an AI agent can search for information online, analyze documents, and interact with external services. The expansion of its functionalities depends on the tools available.

## ⚙️ How Do AI Agents Work?  

We can think of AI agents as intelligent assistants. When you make a request, the agent analyzes it, determines what needs to be done, activates the appropriate tools, and responds based on the obtained results.  

Here’s a workflow illustrating how an AI agent operates:  

1️⃣ The user inputs a command (a question or task to be executed).  
2️⃣ The agent processes the input and determines the necessary action.  
3️⃣ If a tool is required, the agent provides the appropriate input and executes it.  
4️⃣ The agent receives and evaluates the tool's response.  
5️⃣ If the response is insufficient, the process repeats until a satisfactory answer is obtained.  
6️⃣ Once the final response is ready, the agent stops generating new tokens and returns the result to the user.  

One of the key characteristics of AI agents is their ability to know when to stop processing, ensuring efficient task execution.

## 🛠 What Are Tools?  

Tools are essential components that enable AI agents to perform specific tasks. In essence, they are specialized functions that the agent can activate as needed.  

For a tool to be effective, it must:  

✔ Have a well-defined purpose.  
✔ Provide clear documentation (docstring).  
✔ Avoid ambiguous interpretations.  

Some common tools include:  

🔍 **Web Search** – Retrieves up-to-date information.  
🖼 **Image Generation** – Creates images from textual descriptions.  
🔗 **API Interaction** – Queries and processes data from external services.

## 🏗 Developing AI Agents with LangChain  

Now that we understand AI agents and how they work, let's explore them in practice using **LangChain**.  

LangChain is a framework designed to facilitate the development of LLM-based applications, offering native support for agent structures and tool integration.  

With LangChain, we can:  

✅ Build conversational agents that interact with LLMs.  
✅ Integrate tools that interact with external APIs.  
✅ Define decision-making strategies for agents.  
✅ Construct reasoning pipelines to solve complex problems.  

LangChain allows you to combine all these components with minimal code, providing an efficient and flexible approach to developing AI agents.

## 🔥 What Is Ollama and Why Use It?  

[Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) is a framework that enables running language models locally, eliminating the need for cloud-based solutions like OpenAI’s API. This brings several advantages:  

🔐 **Data Privacy** – Models run locally, avoiding external data sharing.  
⚡ **Efficiency** – Optimized for fast and cost-effective LLM execution.  
🔄 **Direct Compatibility with LangChain** – Seamless integration.  
🆓 **Open Source** – Allows customization and use of various AI models.  

In the following project, we use **Ollama** combined with the **Llama3** model to create an AI agent capable of summarizing video transcripts and extracting key information.
